### hello there


I am a youtuber trying to learn how to code.

I do not know much about C++, C#, JS, LUA, or PY.

Would be nice for some help tho.

 

I play Mario 64's coop deluxe mod and some other games. One of the reasons I want to learn lua is because of that game.

I want to learn python to possible make my own game in python.

I also want to learn normal scripting for games that require you to script.

Another reason to learn coding is also website creation.
